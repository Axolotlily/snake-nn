# Snake Neural Network
Genetic algorithm based Neural Network for a AI snake game.
This is just a proof of concept code. Code styles, documentation and organization were partly ignored.
### Setup:

You will need Python 3.X, Flask and p5.js
- Clone Repository
- Run the Flask app in the folder Enpoint.
- Load the main.html file on a browser.
- Enjoy!

#### Notes:
Currently, if the nerual network is loading a saved "brain", the first generation it iterates will be slow, so be patient. 
The other generations should be faster.
